"ATT, I'd do it again","While I think the service is fine, the support is at times suspect. When we open a ticket it is generally acted upon quickly however when a solution is found the ticket is closed. There is no feedback as to what occurred or what was done to resolve the issue.

MPLS Deployment,Chosing a managed service was an excellent option.  It was not core capability of the infrastrcure team.,05-Dec-16,4,CTO,250M - 500M USD,"Director, Information Services",Construction Industry
"High availability, good global reach but some frustrations on the commercial side","Very strong on overall reliability and incident management. Very poor on IMACs and overall technology conversion (EVPN to AVPN, for example). Frustrating on the contracting and some very prolonged commercial issues that drive internal cost (manage, follow-up, reconciliation, etc.).",20-Sep-16,4,"Sourcing, Procurement and Vendor Management",1B - 3B USD,Sr. Commercial Manager,Manufacturing Industry

Implementation was effective but slow.,"AT&T has the technical capabilities. However, in my opinion your experience depends on both your account manager and assigned project manager. They do nothing quickly.",07-Jun-16,3,Program and Portfolio Management,30B + USD,PMO Manager,Finance Industry

"Solid service, but needs better project management to implement.","The MPLS service is solid. The current account team is solid. The implementation team is not well versed in communication. Sources indicate European or Asian outsourcing which cause a communication delay going either direction. The project status for the first three migrations had to be requested throughout the project so far. I had to constantly ask for updates weekly and when dates changed, we did not know about it until I asked, plus the 24+ hour later delayed response. Once the circuits were brought up, the service is solid. Based on negations of cost and credit, we are able to overlook the slow to communicate issue while receiving faster pipes, at a reduced cost to the Opex budget.",09-Dec-15,4,Enterprise Architecture and Technology Innovation,250M - 500M USD,Enterprise Architect,Manufacturing Industry
"No technical challenges, back-office issues with contracts or consistent billing.","The service is functional and stable, ordering and billing are obtuse.",07-Dec-15,4,Infrastructure and Operations,250M - 500M USD,IT Operations Manager,Transportation Industry
